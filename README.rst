========

pyriichi aims to be a Python implementation of standard Japanese Riichi
mahjong.  Though it is less efficient in a sense, I decided to follow actual
play as closely as possible; for example, four walls of double-stacked tiles
are built and players draw four tiles at a time.  Although it is more efficient
to simply randomly form all players' hands, fully implementing the wall and
deal as realistically as possible is the goal.  Thus, pyriichi can also serve
as a model implementation for any mahjong games.  

Also, I will try to document everything, so as to serve as a model for others seeking to make a game.
